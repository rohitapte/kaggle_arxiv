For the\npartial Cu-density of states at E_F and in the region of the valence band we\nobserve no significant difference between a pure superconducting sample and an\ninsulating sample with 60% Pr for Ca. This suggests that the states responsible\nfor superconductivity are predomi- nately O-states.

The peak shows a\nstrongly assymetric Doniach-Sunjic line- shape indicating the presence of a\ncontinuum of electronic states with sharp cut off at E_F even in this\ninsulating sample. This finding excludes a bandgap in the insulating sample and\nsupports the existance of a mobility gap caused by spatial localization of the\ncarriers. The presence of such carriers at the Pr-site, between the CuO_2\nplanes shows that the electronic structure is not purely 2-dimensional but that\nthere is a finite interlayer coupling. The resonance enhancement of the\nphotoemission cross section, at the Pr-4d threshold, was studied for the Pr-4f\nand for Cu-states. Both the Pr-4f and the Cu-states show a Fano-like resonance.\nThis resonance of Cu-states with Pr-states is another indication of coupling\nbetween the the Pr-states and those in the CuO_2 plane.

We find that an applied magnetic field\ncorresponding to 1/2 flux quanta per elementary triangle results in a pi phase\nshift in the current phase relation for all bonds, resulting in an XY\nantiferromagnet. This corresponds to the order-from-disorder selected\nhighly-degenerate coplanar state of the more extensively studied Heisenberg\nKagome antiferromagnet. Using an histogram Monte-Carlo analysis, we observe a\nphase transition at 0.078 of the coupling energy. We find that the jump in the\nsuperfluid density at the transition temperature, determined from a finite-size\nscaling analysis of the magnetization fluctuations, retains its universal value\nwithin the Kosterlitz-Thouless scenario despite the well-known degeneracy of\nthe low-temperature phase. This universal jump, combined with the dramatically\nsuppressed transition temperature, point to a very strong renormalization of\nthe spin stiffness just below the transition temperature. We also observe a\nsequence of ground states corresponding to flux quanta per elementary triangle\nof 1/2, 3/8, 1/4, 1/8, and 0 that, unlike ground states of other lattices,\nconsist of currents of equal magnitude circulating around each elementary\ntriangle in the structure.

We calculated the linear conductance of the system, the profile of\nthe electric field and the densities of states. In the case of transparent\nmetallic boundaries the temperature dependent conductance has a non-monotoneous\n``reentrant'' structure. We argue that this behavior is due to nonequilibrium\neffects occuring in the normal metal in the presence of both superconducting\ncorrelations and the electric field there. Low transparent tunnel barriers\nsuppress the nonequilibrium effects and destroy the reentrant behavior of the\nconductance. If the wire contains a loop, the conductance shows Aharonov-Bohm\noscillations with the period $\\Phi_0=h/2e$ as a function of the magnetic flux\n$\\Phi$ inside the loop. The amplitude of these oscillations also demonstrates\nthe reentrant behavior vanishing at $T=0$ and decaying as $1/T$ at relatively\nlarge temperatures. The latter behavior is due to low energy correlated\nelectrons which penetrate deep into the normal metal and ``feel'' the effect of\nthe magnetic flux $\\Phi$. We point out that the density of states and thus the\n``strengh'' of the proximity effect can be tuned by the value of the flux\ninside the loop.

Small positive values of the isotope\nexponent are obtained for strengths of pair tunneling that give high transition\ntemperatures.\n", "report-no": null, "categories": ["supr-con cond-mat.supr-con"], "versions": ["v1"]}

Many\nproperties of the FLL are well described by the phenomenological\nGinzburg-Landau theory or by the electromagnetic London theory, which treats\nthe vortex core as a singularity. In Nb alloys and HTSC's the FLL is very soft\nmainly because of the large magnetic penetration depth: The shear modulus of\nthe FLL is thus small and the tilt modulus is dispersive and becomes very small\nfor short distortion wavelength. This softness of the FLL is enhanced further\nby the pronounced anisotropy and layered structure of HTSC's, which strongly\nincreases the penetration depth for currents along the c-axis of these uniaxial\ncrystals and may even cause a decoupling of two-dimensional vortex lattices in\nthe Cu-O layers. Thermal fluctuations and softening may melt the FLL and cause\nthermally activated depinning of the flux lines or of the 2D pancake vortices\nin the layers. Various phase transitions are predicted for the FLL in layered\nHTSC's.

Using resonant photoemission we study how this\nchemical substitution affects the electronic structure of the material. For the\npartial Cu-density of states at E_F and in the region of the valence band we\nobserve no significant difference between a pure superconducting sample and an\ninsulating sample with 60% Pr for Ca. This suggests that the states responsible\nfor superconductivity are predomi- nately O-states. The partial Pr-4f density\nof states was extracted utilizing the Super- Koster-Kronig Pr 4d-4f resonance.\nIt consists of a single peak at 1.36eV binding energy. The peak shows a\nstrongly assymetric Doniach-Sunjic line- shape indicating the presence of a\ncontinuum of electronic states with sharp cut off at E_F even in this\ninsulating sample. This finding excludes a bandgap in the insulating sample and\nsupports the existance of a mobility gap caused by spatial localization of the\ncarriers. The presence of such carriers at the Pr-site, between the CuO_2\nplanes shows that the electronic structure is not purely 2-dimensional but that\nthere is a finite interlayer coupling. The resonance enhancement of the\nphotoemission cross section, at the Pr-4d threshold, was studied for the Pr-4f\nand for Cu-states. Both the Pr-4f and the Cu-states show a Fano-like resonance.\nThis resonance of Cu-states with Pr-states is another indication of coupling\nbetween the the Pr-states and those in the CuO_2 plane. Because of the\nstatistical distribution of the Pr-ions this coupling leads to a non-periodic\npotential for the states in the CuO_2 plane which can lead to localization and\nthus to the observed metal-insulator transition.\n", "report-no": "UW-Physics 11/1", "categories": ["cond-mat supr-con"], "versions": ["v1"]}

When\n$t^{\\prime }=0$, it is induced by antiferromagnetic correlations while at\n$t^{\\prime }=-0.35t$ it is a band structure effect amplified by interactions.\nFinally, pairing fluctuations are compared with $% T $-matrix results to\ndisentangle the effects of van Hove singularity and of nesting on\nsuperconducting correlations. The addition of antiferromagnetic fluctuations\nincreases slightly the $d$-wave superconducting correlations despite the\npresence of a van Hove singularity which tends to decrease them in the\nrepulsive model. Some aspects of the phase diagram and some subtleties of\nfinite-size scaling in Monte Carlo simulations, such as inverted finite-size\ndependence, are also discussed.\n", "report-no": "CRPS-95-19", "categories": ["cond-mat supr-con"], "versions": ["v1"]}
