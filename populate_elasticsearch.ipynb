      "Starting with a graph, two players take turns in either deleting an edge or deleting a vertex and all incident edges. The player removing the last vertex wins. We review the known results for this game and extend the computation of nim-values to new families of graphs. A conjecture of Khandhawit and Ye on the nim-values of graphs with one odd cycle is proved. We also see that, for wheels and their subgraphs, this game exhibits a surprising amount of unexplained regularity.\n",
      "We give the first polynomial-time algorithm for coloring vertices of P_5-free graphs with k colors. This settles an open problem and generalizes several previously known results.\n",
      "We prove algorithmic weak and \\Szemeredi{} regularity lemmas for several classes of sparse graphs in the literature, for which only weak regularity lemmas were previously known. These include core-dense graphs, low threshold rank graphs, and (a version of) $L^p$ upper regular graphs. More precisely, we define \\emph{cut pseudorandom graphs}, we prove our regularity lemmas for these graphs, and then we show that cut pseudorandomness captures all of the above graph classes as special cases.   The core of our approach is an abstracted matrix decomposition, roughly following Frieze and Kannan [Combinatorica '99] and \\Lovasz{} and Szegedy [Geom.\\ Func.\\ Anal.\\ '07], which can be computed by a simple algorithm by Charikar [AAC0 '00]. This gives rise to the class of cut pseudorandom graphs, and using work of Oveis Gharan and Trevisan [TOC '15], it also implies new PTASes for MAX-CUT, MAX-BISECTION, MIN-BISECTION for a significantly expanded class of input graphs. (It is NP Hard to get PTASes for these graphs in general.)\n",
      "We introduce a new notion of resilience for constraint satisfaction problems, with the goal of more precisely determining the boundary between NP-hardness and the existence of efficient algorithms for resilient instances. In particular, we study $r$-resiliently $k$-colorable graphs, which are those $k$-colorable graphs that remain $k$-colorable even after the addition of any $r$ new edges. We prove lower bounds on the NP-hardness of coloring resiliently colorable graphs, and provide an algorithm that colors sufficiently resilient graphs. We also analyze the corresponding notion of resilience for $k$-SAT. This notion of resilience suggests an array of open questions for graph coloring and other combinatorial problems.\n",
      "We provide a polynomial-time algorithm for b-Coloring on graphs of constant clique-width. This unifies and extends previously known polynomial-time results on several graph classes, and answers open questions posed by Campos and Silva [Algorithmica, 2018] and Bonomo et al. [Graphs Combin., 2009]. This constitutes the first result concerning structural parameterizations of this problem. We show that the problem is FPT when parameterized by the vertex cover number on general graphs, and on chordal graphs when parameterized by the number of colors. Additionally, we observe that our algorithm for graphs of bounded clique-width can be adapted to solve the Fall Coloring problem within the same runtime bound.\n",
      "In this paper, we propose and study a new semi-random model for graph partitioning problems. We believe that it captures many properties of real--world instances. The model is more flexible than the semi-random model of Feige and Kilian and planted random model of Bui, Chaudhuri, Leighton and Sipser.   We develop a general framework for solving semi-random instances and apply it to several problems of interest. We present constant factor bi-criteria approximation algorithms for semi-random instances of the Balanced Cut, Multicut, Min Uncut, Sparsest Cut and Small Set Expansion problems. We also show how to almost recover the optimal solution if the instance satisfies an additional expanding condition. Our algorithms work in a wider range of parameters than most algorithms for previously studied random and semi-random models.   Additionally, we study a new planted algebraic expander model and develop constant factor bi-criteria approximation algorithms for graph partitioning problems in this model.\n",
      "We study the integrality gap of the natural linear programming relaxation for the \\textit{Bounded Color Matching} (BCM) problem. We provide several families of instances and establish lower bounds on their integrality gaps and we study how the Sherali-Adams \"lift-and-project\" technique behaves on these instances. We complement these results by showing that if we exclude certain simple sub-structures from our input graphs, then the integrality gap of the natural linear formulation strictly improves. To prove this, we adapt for our purposes the results of F\\\"{u}redi [\\emph{Combinatorica}, 1(2):155-162, 1981]. We further leverage this to show upper bounds on the performance of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy when applied to the natural LP relaxation of the BCM problem.\n",
      "Let $G$ be a simple $n$-vertex graph and $c$ be a colouring of $E(G)$ with $n$ colours, where each colour class has size at least $2$. We prove that $(G,c)$ contains a rainbow cycle of length at most $\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\rceil$, which is best possible. Our result settles a special case of a strengthening of the Caccetta-H\\\"aggkvist conjecture, due to Aharoni. We also show that the matroid generalization of our main result also holds for cographic matroids, but fails for binary matroids.\n",
      "A multi-graph $G$ on $n$ vertices is $(k,\\ell)$-sparse if every subset of $n'\\leq n$ vertices spans at most $kn'- \\ell$ edges. $G$ is {\\em tight} if, in addition, it has exactly $kn - \\ell$ edges. For integer values $k$ and $\\ell \\in [0, 2k)$, we characterize the $(k,\\ell)$-sparse graphs via a family of simple, elegant and efficient algorithms called the $(k,\\ell)$-pebble games.\n"
